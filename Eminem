His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, the force grows on the jedi 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop some drone, but he keeps on forgettin' 
What he cut down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his bag, but the swords won't come out 
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now 
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!

Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Anakin, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No 
He won't have it, he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, 
He's dope, he knows that, but he's numb 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to Tatooine again yo, this whole rhapsody 
And that's how it ends so don't bother anymore.
